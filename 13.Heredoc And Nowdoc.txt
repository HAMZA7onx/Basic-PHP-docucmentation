<?php 
    $name = 'Hamza'; 

    // Heredoc 
    echo <<<"HERE"
    Hello PHP 
    Special Characters $$$ ' ' ' """"" \\\\ 
    Hello My Name Is $name 
    HERE; 

    echo '<br>'; 

    // Nowdoc 
    echo <<<'NOW'
    Hello PHP 
    Special Characters $$$ ' ' ' """"" \\\\ 
    Hello My Name Is $name 
    NOW; 
?>
OUTPUT: 
Hello PHP Special Characters $$$ ' ' ' """"" \\ Hello My Name Is Hamza
Hello PHP Special Characters $$$ ' ' ' """"" \\\\ Hello My Name Is $name







Note: // 2 ways to represent Heredoc (Double Quotes)===> "HERE"
                                     (Nothing)      ===>  HERE  

      // Nowdoc  ===> 'NOW' <- (Single Quotes is necessary)

.Heredoc: You still have access to your variables
.Nowdoc : Everything is a string 


VERY IMPORTANT: 

echo <<< HERE<--------------- <Should there is no space after The heredoc or nowdoc:
    <body>
        <div>title</div>  
    </body>
    HERE;
     | 
    herdoc or nowdow must should not depass the level of the content before it, Which is in that case the body format.
