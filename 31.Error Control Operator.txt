`exit()` and `die()` functions both of them used to End the execution of a program: 
// Situation 1:
<?php
    // $a = 10; 
    $b = @$a || die("EOP");
    echo $b; 
    echo '<br>';
    echo 'HAMZA';
?> 
OUTPUT: 
EOP

// Situation 2: 
<?php
    $a = 10; 
    $b = @$a || die("EOP");
    echo $b; 
    echo '<br>';
    echo 'HAMZA';
?> 
OUTPUT: 
10
HAMZA


=>@$a  @symbole means if that variable wasn't declared consider it nothing.
	So we can set that symbole before any function or variable that it possible not exist: 
	@$name
	@file("file.txt"); 
	@include("code.php");
=> die("END") / exit("END");
